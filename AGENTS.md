# AGENTS.md

This file defines how coding agents should work in the `IsaacLabImitation` workspace.

## Scope

- This guidance is for the top-level `IsaacLabImitation` repo only.
- Do not add or maintain agent guidance inside vendored submodules.
- Treat `IsaacLab/`, `RLOpt/`, and `ImitationLearningTools/` as dependencies unless a task explicitly requires changes there.
- Do not edit the vendored submodule at `IsaacLab-Imitation/RLOpt/`; for RLOpt work, use the sibling installed repo at `/home/fwu91/Documents/Research/SkillLearning/RLOpt`.
- The workspace also expects the upstream `IsaacLab`, `unitree_rl_lab`, and `loco-mujoco` repositories to be available either as git submodules in this repo or as sibling checkouts next to it.
- Prefer edits in files owned by this repo, especially:
  - `source/isaaclab_imitation/`
  - `scripts/`
  - `docker/`
  - `README.md`
  - `REPO_SETUP.md`
  - top-level config files such as `pyrefly.toml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

## Environment

- Use the conda environment `SkillLearning` for development, linting, and tests.
- Prefer `conda run -n SkillLearning ...` for non-interactive commands.
- If you need an interactive shell, activate with:

```bash
conda activate SkillLearning
```

- Use `uv` inside that environment for package installation and Python tooling.
- The documented workspace installer is:

```bash
conda run -n SkillLearning ./scripts/install_workspace.sh
```

- The installer expects Python `3.11` and installs the local packages plus Isaac Sim / PyTorch dependencies.

## Repo Shape

- `source/isaaclab_imitation/`: installable Isaac Lab extension package for imitation environments.
- `scripts/rlopt/`: RLOpt train, test, and playback entrypoints.
- `scripts/rsl_rl/`: RSL-RL training entrypoints.
- `scripts/zero_agent.py`, `scripts/random_agent.py`: smoke-test runners.
- `docker/`: container and cluster-related workflows.
- `logs/`, `outputs/`: generated run artifacts; do not treat them as source.

## Working Rules

- Read `README.md` first when changing setup, training, or execution workflows.
- Keep changes aligned with the existing terminal-first workflow.
- Prefer minimal, targeted edits over broad refactors.
- Preserve Isaac Lab / Hydra CLI patterns already used in `scripts/`.
- Do not assume IDE-only workflows; command-line verification is the default here.
- Avoid committing generated artifacts, caches, checkpoints, or log directories.

## Validation

Run the smallest relevant checks from the repo root, using `SkillLearning`.

General checks:

```bash
conda run -n SkillLearning ruff check .
conda run -n SkillLearning ruff format --check .
conda run -n SkillLearning pyrefly check
```

If you changed formatting intentionally:

```bash
conda run -n SkillLearning ruff format .
```

For workspace setup changes, verify the installer or README commands still match:

```bash
conda run -n SkillLearning ./scripts/install_workspace.sh
```

For environment or training-entry changes, prefer a targeted smoke test over broad execution:

```bash
conda run -n SkillLearning ./IsaacLab/isaaclab.sh -p scripts/zero_agent.py --task Isaac-Imitation-G1-LafanTrack-v0
```

Use heavier training or playback commands only when the task requires them.

## Submodule Boundary

- Do not “fix” code inside `IsaacLab/`, `RLOpt/`, or `ImitationLearningTools/` as part of routine top-level work.
- For any `rlopt` Python import or code change, assume the sibling repo `../RLOpt` is authoritative and ignore the vendored `IsaacLab-Imitation/RLOpt` submodule.
- If a top-level change depends on submodule behavior, first see whether the issue can be solved from this repo through config, wrappers, scripts, or documentation.
- If a submodule edit is truly required, call it out explicitly in your summary.

## When Updating Docs

- Keep `README.md` and command examples consistent with actual scripts in this repo.
- Prefer absolute clarity about required sibling or submodule checkouts such as `IsaacLab`, `unitree_rl_lab`, and `loco-mujoco`, and document the expected directory layout explicitly.
- When mentioning execution commands, show them from the repository root.
